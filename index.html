    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This website presents a detailed Marketing Mix (4Ps) case study of Ajce  In today’s competitive educational environment, colleges must
        effectively design and communicate their academic offerings, pricing strategies,
        service delivery methods, and promotional activities to attract and retain students.

    <p>
        As a student, I analyze how my college applies the four elements of marketing —
        Product, Price, Place, and Promotion — and evaluate their effectiveness from a
        learner’s perspective.
